### Frameworks
[Angular-UI](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap "Angular-UI")

#### [Bower](http://bower.io/ "Bower") is a front-end package manager for the web.

Install bower globaly using npm:

    npm install -g bower

Bower acts a lot like npm.  There is a bower.json file that contains all of our package dependencies with version numbers.  We can easily install all of the packages with:

    bower install

We can add new packages:

    bower install angular-bootstrap --save

The "--save" flag tells bower to add this to our bower.json file as a dependency.
